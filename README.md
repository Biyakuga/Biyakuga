# Biyakuga Higashiri

### About
My name is _`Biyakuga Higashiri`_ and I am a freelance developer with a passion for user experience, user interfaces, games, tools, and in general, anything that can be coded.

Besides, I am one of the founders and the current owner of the group Nostalgia Community in the discord app.
We are doing amazing things there, such as developing tools to run old games from the 80s and 90s decades on modern computer  systems.

Moreover, Besides programming, I love spending time with friends and family. I can often be found together going out catching the latest movie, staying in playing games on the sofa, or planning a trip to someplace I've never been before.

Last but not least, make sure to check out the [ChangeLog](CHANGELOG.md "Versions File") file for all the changes in this repository.
